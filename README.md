# React GitHub Page Testing
Testing out functionality to make a GitHub page that uses React.js

Started: August 7th, 2025

## General Repository Structure
The repository currently has 2 branches: _main_ and _gh-pages_. _main_ will house the entire source code, which _gh-pages_ will be the one to make the website deployment. I'm not currently sure how _gh-pages_ works in terms of converting React.js into something that can be used for GitHub Pages.
